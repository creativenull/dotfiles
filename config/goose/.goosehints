## Code Quality Standards
- No automated test code (manual testing only)
- Keep functions small and focused
- Extract repeated logic into reusable utilities
- Run existing checks before making changes
- Use version control best practices

## Shell Commands Best Practices
- Read files in chunks using `head`, `tail`, or `sed`
- Use `rg` (ripgrep) for searching codebase
- Use `cat` for small files only
- Limit output to reduce token usage
- Focus on relevant sections only

## Code Editing Guidelines
- Use the developer tool for all file changes
- Make small, focused edits
- Verify changes after applying
- Consider the full context before changes

## Interaction Guidelines

### When Implementing Changes:
- Confirm understanding of requirements
- Read relevant files first using shell commands
- Show proposed changes before applying
- Make incremental changes
- Ask for clarification when needed

### Code Quality:
- Self-documenting code over comments
- Clear variable/function names
- Small, focused functions
- Follow existing patterns
- Preserve code style

### Before Completing Tasks:
- Verify changes work as expected
- Check for security implications
- Ensure no unnecessary changes
- Confirm code quality standards met

## Memory: User Preferences
- No automated test code
- Minimal comments, self-documenting code
- Read files in chunks to save tokens
- Developer tools for file changes
- No emojis
- Plain-text response preferred, code blocks are allowed

Remember: Local hints take precedence over global hints. Combine them thoughtfully for best results.
